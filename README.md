# IT-Careers web application
My first simple web application made along the Youtube tuturial: [Web Development with Python Tutorial â€“ Flask & Dynamic Database-Driven Web Apps](https://youtu.be/yBDHkveJUf4?si=fVxvdweCuw2QvlgN) created by freeCodeCamp.org

You can view it by clicking this [link](https://it-career.onrender.com/) (It may take some time to load the page, because I chose a free plan on onrender.com platform)
